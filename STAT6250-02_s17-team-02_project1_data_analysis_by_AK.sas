This file uses the following analytic dataset to address several research
questions regarding flight delay in US airports
Dataset Name: DelayedFlight.csv created in external file having three months
STAT6250-02_s17-team-02_project1_data_preparation.sas, which is assumed to be
in the same directory as this file
See included file for dataset properties
;

* environmental setup;

* set relative file import path to current directory (using standard SAS trick;
X "cd ""%substr(%sysget(SAS_EXECFILEPATH),1,
%eval(%length(%sysget(SAS_EXECFILEPATH))-%length(%sysget(SAS_EXECFILENAME))))""";
* load external file that generates analytic dataset FRPM1516_analytic_file;

Question 1:  What is the average weather delay of each carrier?
Rationale: To identify the top 10 carriers which are most impacted due to weather condition?
Methodology: Using KEEP and IF Command we have only selected required variables and removed all 
			records which are not delayed using weather.
			We have created new temp data set to change the data type from character to numeric to 
			do statistical analysis. Use PROC MEAN to compute the mean of weather delay and store 
			the result in temporary dataset. Used PROC SORT to sort the temporary dataset.

Rationale: To identify the carriers which flights are diverted most of the time?
Methodology: Using PROC SORT commands sort the data set. Using PROC FREQ command percentage of
